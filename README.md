# MLE project for IRIS Dataset
The project consists of three main parts: 
* Data processing
* Model training
* Inference
In the repository you will also find some other files:
* .gitignore - I'm not uploading model files, inference/prediction csvs, pycache and notebooks used for testing. (I did incude a data folder as specifed in the homework)
* requirements.txt - all the dependencies needed
